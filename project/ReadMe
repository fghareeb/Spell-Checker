This project was done by Fuad Ghareeb, Alishba Farhan, Yazan hunjul, Mohammed Rafic and Adam Seif.

Here is how you can use it:

This will launch javaFx GUI.
From their you can upload a file with a .txt extension using the upload button to the left of the screen.
Pressing done will take you back to the home screen with a loading sign.
Depending on your file size it should shortly populte the text area infront of you with the text of your uploaded document.
To the right you will see three categories of errors by clicking on any error fixing tab should appear.
Applying changes will then refresh the page and update the erros.
To the left you can save the file, access metrics of the document or change settings.

For the delimiters you can update them and that becomes effective right after you re-upload your file.
